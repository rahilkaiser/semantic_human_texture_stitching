# Semantic Human Texture Stitching

This repository contains texture stitching code corresponding to the paper **Detailed Human Avatars from Monocular Video**.

## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

We provide sample scripts and data. All scripts output usage information when executed without parameters.

The software consists of three parts:

1. `step1_make_unwraps.py`: Creates partial textures.
2. `step2_segm_vote_gmm.py`: Creates semantic and GMM priors.
3. `step3_stitch_texture.py`: Stitches final texture.

### Quick start

```
bash run_sample.sh
```


## Data preparation

If you want to process your own data, some pre-processing steps are needed:

1. Run [PGN semantic segmentation](https://github.com/Engineering-Course/CIHP_PGN) on your input frames.
2. Run per-frame 3D pose detection plus SMPL offsets estimation e.g. by using [Octopus](https://github.com/thmoa/octopus).
3. Create the `frame_data.pkl` input file according to the following layout:

```
{
    "width": <image width>,
    "height": <image height>,
    "camera_f": <camera focal length>,
    "camera_c": <camera center>,
    "vertices": [<list of per frame SMPL vertices in camera coordinates>]
}
```
